            <h2>Everythings of Photography in one place.</h2>
            <p>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.

Holland Day, and Edward Weston, spent their lives advocating for photography as a fine art.</p>
